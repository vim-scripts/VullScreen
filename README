Vull..what?
*************
Nothing fancy here (Except the strange name), vullScreen is a small vim plugin that allows you to toggle Vim in full-screen mode on GNU/Linux.

I'm talking about a real full-screen mode, no menu and no toolbars as shown in the following gif.

To get the last version or to have more informations check the github repo > https://github.com/KabbAmine/vullScreen.vim
Don't forget to rate it if you find it useful ( Or useless ;) ). 

How to use?
***************
With the command:

    :VullScreen

Or using the key `<F11>` in both *NORMAL* and *INSERT* mode.

Why F11?
************
Because its nice and common to a lot of programs, but if you want to change it to something else simply add to your `vimrc`:
   
    let g:vullscreen_key = '<SOMETHING ELSE>'

Notes
*******
You don't really need this plugin if you're using Vim on a terminal (The full-screen option is included in most graphical terminals).
